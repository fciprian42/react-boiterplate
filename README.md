# React Boiterplate

This is a react boiterplate which is wrapped by mono-repo PNPM

Inside the boiterplate you will use `vitejs` for compile and build your project faster!

Some librairies are include inside, like `redux` `react-query` `styled-components` and `react-router`

And finally your unit tests will be written in `jest` and `@testing-library/react` 

All the packages are updated to their last version.

```bash
  pnpm i
